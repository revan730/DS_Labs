Graph analysis program
# **Classes overview:**
*Graph.cs* - Implements oriented,weighted graph and most analysis operations
*Vertex.cs* - stores vertex id,adjacent vertices and other properties
*Edge.cs* - stores source and distination vertices of an edge,and it's weight
*dfs.cs* - implements DFS algorithm based operations,like topological sorting
*bfs.cs* - implements BFS algorithm
*Johnson.cs* - implements Johnson`s algorithm for shortest paths search
